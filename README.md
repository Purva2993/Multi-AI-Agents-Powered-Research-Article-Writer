> An AI-powered content creation system where multiple specialized agents work together to research, write, and edit professional articles on any topic. Just enter a subject and get a complete, ready-to-publish article.

## 🎯 **What This Does**

Transform any topic into a professional, SEO-optimized article in minutes! This system uses three specialized AI agents that work like a real editorial team:

- **📋 Content Planner**: Researches trends, identifies audience, creates outlines
- **✍️ Content Writer**: Writes engaging, well-structured articles  
- **✏️ Content Editor**: Polishes grammar, tone, and overall quality

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Three AI agents working as a coordinated team
- **🔄 Fully Autonomous**: Just input a topic and let the AI do the rest
- **📊 Dynamic Content**: Real-time research and trend analysis
- **💾 Auto-Save**: Articles saved as markdown files with topic-based naming
- **🎨 SEO Optimized**: Includes keywords and proper content structure
- **⚡ Fast Generation**: Complete articles in minutes, not hours
- **🌐 Any Topic**: Works for technology, business, health, science, and more
